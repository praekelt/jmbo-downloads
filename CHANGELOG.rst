Changelog
=========

0.0.7
-----
#. Temporary downloads adhere to `DOWNLOAD_SERVE_FROM` setting. They are always created on the local filesystem though. If 'REMOTE' is used the developer needs to sync these files with a remote filesystem.

0.0.6
-----
#. Add `DOWNLOAD_INTERNAL_REDIRECT_HEADER` setting (default 'X-Accel-Redirect') in case a webserver other than Nginx is used.
#. Add `DOWNLOAD_SERVE_FROM` setting (default 'LOCAL') to specify whether to serve the files locally or redirect to a remote location.

0.0.5
-----
#. Fix bug where X-Accel-Redirect uses file name override instead of actual file name to serve download, causing a 404 if the file name and override don't match.

0.0.4 (2012-06-21)
------------------
#. South dependency on jmbo upped to 0002 migration.

0.0.3 (2012-06-15)
------------------

#. Make ImageMod more generic and rename it to TemporaryDownloadAbstract.
#. Send signal when a download is requested, allowing other apps to track downloads.
